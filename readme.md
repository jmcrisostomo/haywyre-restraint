## Restraint Lyrics ##

<pre>[Interlude]
Every concept, every notion has a counterpart
Yet, every idea's opposite
Is just the absence of the idea itself
Absence is the absence of presence
But presence is the absence of absence
Any perceived difference is, in fact, also a deep connection
In this way, opposing forces are unified
And the world becomes a cooperative web
Of interdependent pieces</pre>
